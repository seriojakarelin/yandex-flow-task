Part 3. Feedbacks.

A waiter is the person who takes your order in a restaurant and brings food to the table. A waiter is called a "waiter" because they wait for people to sit at tables.
Официант — это человек, который принимает у вас заказ в ресторане и приносит еду за стол. Слово waiter ("официант") происходит от главгола "wait" ("ждать"), потому что официант ждёт пока люди рассядутся за столы.

Yeah, so I taught English abroad for over 15 years. I used to live in a really [charming|очаровательном] little town in Vietnam. Life was good.

So I had to start [couchsurfing|ночевать по знакомым]. But you know, you need to know when [to stop being a burden|перестать быть обузой], so I [opted for|предпочёл] sleeping rough in that park.

Part 5. Communication. 

Hey Jason, 

Thanks for your content for Flow! It`s really great but we have a minor edit I`d like to discuss. 
As we see it, the current context for <overweight> term is hardly understandable for Russian students because <Dad bod> is a slang that we don`t really have here. That`s why we consider using it is not suitable since students might not know it.

I offer to change this point to something not so foreign for Russian people. 

For example: 

A: Hey, how are you doing?
B: Hey, not so great actually. I`ve got a lot of work, I`ve stopped going to the gym and I`m getting overweight.

Thanks for your attention. I look forward to feedback from you.
Regards, 
Serioja Karelin
